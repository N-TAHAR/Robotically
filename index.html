          <span class="first">A</span>rtificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals.
            In computer science AI research is defined as the study of <em>"intelligent agents"</em>: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.
            Colloquially, the term <em>"artificial intelligence"</em> is applied when a machine mimics <em>"cognitive"</em> functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as <em>"learning"</em> and <em>"problem solving"</em>.

          <span class="first">T</span>he field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College during the summer of 1956. 
          Those who attended would become the leaders of AI research for decades. 
          Many of them predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist in no more than a generation and they were given millions of dollars to make this vision come true.
